# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.3.0] - 2025-01-21

### Fixed
- **MQTT Unicode Support** - Fixed MQTT SMS sending to properly handle Unicode messages
- MQTT method now respects `"unicode": true` parameter in JSON payload (was previously ignored)
- Unicode messages sent via MQTT now display correctly instead of showing ????

### Technical Details
- Updated `mqtt_publisher.py` to extract and use unicode parameter from MQTT JSON payload
- Modified `_send_sms_via_gammu()` method to accept unicode_mode parameter
- Fixed hard-coded `"Unicode": False` that prevented Unicode encoding in MQTT messages
- MQTT Unicode handling now matches REST API and Native HA Service behavior

## [1.2.9] - 2025-01-19

### Fixed
- **Signal Strength Sensor** - Removed invalid `device_class: "signal_strength"` to make sensor appear in Home Assistant
- **MQTT Discovery** - Signal strength sensor now properly discovered and displayed in HA

### Technical Details
- Signal strength sensor uses percentage (%) instead of dBm, so device_class was incompatible
- Removed device_class allows HA to treat it as generic sensor with % unit
